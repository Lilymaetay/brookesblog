KFC went viral this week and not for reasons you would expect. Known for its 'finger-licking' good chicken the company serves roughly 12 million customers daily contributing to making an annual profit well over £20 billion. Surprisingly it wasn't the amazing chicken that made the company go viral but rather the logo of  Colonel Sanders.

The tweet has made it to numerous headlines in the UK and around the world such as The Independent, 7news, and Msn. 

The colonel has one of the most recognizable faces in the world. When you think of KFC you think of the colonel more than the chicken itself. Sanders has been the face of the company since its beginning but we never really get to see his full body, until now...

Freddie Champion is the creator of the viral tweet. On December 16th he posted this statement 

> "My wife just confessed that for her entire childhood she thought Colonel Sanders’ bow tie was his whole body and now I can’t stop seeing a tiny stick body every time I look at him."

I don't think any of us will ever look the Colonel the same way again. His body was right there in front of us all along. We just never noticed.

The KFC logo itself is rather bold with the shade black being used for the Colonels face and 'bow-tie'. Perhaps this is why we have never noticed his tiny body before as there as his body is all in black. 

The tweet itself managed to gather nearly half a million likes and retweeted over 59 thousand times. 

The story doesn't just end here though, Freddie took it a step further and requested all KFC employees attach their GoFundMe pages in the messages section in order for people to donate money for their medical bills.  

> "If you work at KFC and you have a GoFundMe to pay for medical bills drop the link here"
>
> "This has enough retweets now \[more than 33,000 as we write this] that the people at KFC HQ have definitely seen it, so seems like a good opportunity to remind them they need to pay their employees a living wage."

This kind gesture will definitely bring a smile to KFC workers, especially at Christmas. Media platforms are under scrutiny every day for its damaging effect upon the population but here are just some examples of how beneficial it can be to society. It can make people laugh and spread awareness.
