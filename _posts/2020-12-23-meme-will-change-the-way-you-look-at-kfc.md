KFC went viral this week and not for reasons you would expect. Known for its 'finger-licking' good chicken the company serves roughly 12 million customers daily contributing to making an annual profit well over Â£20 billion. Surprisingly it wasn't the amazing chicken that made the company go viral but rather the logo of the Colonel Himself. 

The colonel has one of the most recognizable faces in the world. When you think of KFC you think of the colonel more than the chicken itself. Sanders has been the face of the company since its beginning but we never really get to see his full body, until now...

Freddie Campion (see below) tweeted about how as a child his wife believed the Colonels bow tie was actually his body. Like a 'tiny stick figure'. As mentioned in my previous blogs many logos carry secret messages but most aren't as funny as this one.
