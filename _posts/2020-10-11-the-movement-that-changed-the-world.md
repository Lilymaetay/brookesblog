It’s crazy to see how in this modern era people are still being judged upon over something so stupid as the colour of their skin. I think for a long time the world wanted change and the Black lives matter movement gives us that opportunity to share our anger and pain. After the death of George Floyd on … the world united and marched from streets on all continents in the hope that change will come.

World noticing

For me what was most striking was the word wide and societal impact the movement has on society. Through the use of social media people are far more likely to express their views. It created this chain effect whereby as soon as one person shared an image or a message about the protests people followed. Media has become far more political rather than being used as a platform whereby we share our self-obsessed images of our idealistic lives. With so many people involved in the movement it was not a surprise when society started to show change in accordance to the protest.
