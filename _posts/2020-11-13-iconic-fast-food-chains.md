Fast-food chains have dominated the food industry for decades. In 2018 alone the fast food industry was worth $256 billion in 2018. What makes the fast food industry so iconic and memorable though is its famous Logos. From McDonalds to KFC each logo is memorisable throughout the world and attracts millions of visitors every year. 



**McDonalds**

Introduced in 1968 the McDonalds logo is famous throughout the world. The simple yet bold 'M' was designed by Jesse Burgheimer and is known as McLawsuit. The font itself is available in 99 characters and not in lowercase. The vibrant, contrasting colours of the red and yellow further attract the consumers attention. 

**KFC**

KFC was famously founded by Colonel Harland Sanders within the year 1952. Colonel Sanders is iconic to the brand. To this day a smiling portrait of the Colonel is still found on all the companies logos. This sweet memorial for the founder prepares the visitors for a pleasant experience whilst also holding onto the principles first introduced by Colonel Sanders. The way in which he is coloured in white further portrays him in an angelic angle. 

The font style within the logo was designed by Victor Caruso, Ernst Friz and Thierry PuyFoulhoux and is known as Friz Quadrata. By having a white font against a red background not only matches with the image of the Colonel but also makes it stand out more with lighter against darker, solid tones.
