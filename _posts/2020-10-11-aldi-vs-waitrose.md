It is a debate my mother has been making for years. Whether to splash the cash at Waitrose or Tesco's or go for a bargain at Aldi. I can't even taste a difference between the products so it doesn't matter to me. What does stand out however is the fact that Aldi alters brands logos and makes them their own with ever so slight adjustments. This genius marketing tatic confuses shoppers on the daily as to whether they will be eating the real deal or not. I want to take some of my favourite foods from both Aldi and the original brands and see how the package style looks different. 

Rich Teas

*Mcvitie's*

The OG of all biscuits... MCVITIE'S. A delicious product, with a very good dunking consistency good for when you want to dip it in tea. As shown the brand is famous for it's blue packaging. It reminds me of a royal blue, only adding to the effect that it is the ruler of biscuits. The font itself is very bold and white which only makes it stand out more. The text has a slight curve looking effect to the style, making it far more classier than just plain straight lines. It reminds me of fonts similar to 'Lucinda Handwriting' or 'French Script'. Very fancy!

At a first glance you may argue that this is the same product as the original... You are wrong. These are in fact in a whole other league, Aldi league.   The product is almost identical to that of Mcvities. The shades of blue are pretty much the same yet on this packaging there is no gradient between the blue and white. The font as well, although incredibly similar, is far less classier than the Mcvities. Seems even to be a little bolder. In a way this product looks a little cheaper with basic graphics shown eg of the teapot however from experience I can assure you both taste completley the same.
