*Coca Cola* commonly refered to as *Coke.* Established in 1886, the brand is known not only for its unique taste but also the iconic logo. Over the years the taste and ingrediants of the product may ahve chnaged but the logo has remained the same. Lets take a look through time and see how the historical logo has changed.

Before coke introduced its iconic, trademark logo the style was very basic. John pemberton (the creator of coke) used a very basic font for the advertisement of the drink, similar to that of Calibri.

In 1887 Dr John Pemberton's bookeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, designed the curvier font which we are familiar with today. The font is written in Spencerian Script, the dominant form of writing font within the USA at the time.
